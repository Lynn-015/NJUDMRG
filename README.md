# NJU DMRG
This is a project python(combined fortran) implementation of
Density Matrix Renormalization Group(DMRG), Matrix Product State(MPS) Tensor NetWork(TN) theory, supported by NanJing University.

*Note: MPS is to some extent, the advanced version of DMRG, and TN is it's generalization to higher dimension.
They are strongly recommended as a replacement of the old formed DMRG.*

C++ version

ITensor Project, maintained by Jessica Alfonsi, Gonzalo Alvarez et. al.
It is (relatively) well documented, widely used in the worldwide,
and should be the first choice for those who is not interested in improving the basic idea of DMRG, MPS, and TN.
